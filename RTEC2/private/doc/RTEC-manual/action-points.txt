---Present the declarations language precisely, taking into consideration RTEC's changelog.
+The same fluent must have the same index.
+All values of a simple fluent must be declared.

---Present the execution scripts.

---What is the meaning of the different colours in the listings?

---Add information about the built-in start(F=V) and end(F=V) events: in Section 2 for expressivity, but then Section 2.1 should appear after the fluents; and in the description of the figure illustrating maIntervalsFromPoints where an initiating point is computed at the beginning of an input entity interval.

---Present a formal account of expressivity. See RTEC2 paper.

---Present RTEC2.

---Present a gentle, brief intro to the event calculus

---Present algorithm for simple fluent processing.

---Present algorithm for event processing.

---Present the simple language (commonsense17 paper); this section has been commented out.


NOTES:
- Section 2 is mainly about expressivity.
- Section 3 gives an example of reasoning.
- Section 4 presents the operation of RTEC.
