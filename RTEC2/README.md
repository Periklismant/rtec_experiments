# RTEC: Run-Time Event Calculus

RTEC is an open-source [Event Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_calculus) dialect optimised for stream reasoning. It is written in Prolog and has been tested under [YAP 6.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAP_(Prolog)).

# Features
- Interval-based.
- Sliding window reasoning.
- Interval manipulation constructs for non-inertial fluents.
- Caching for hierarchical knowledge bases.
- Support for out-of-order data streams.
- Indexing for handling efficiently irrelevant data.

# File Description

To run RTEC you need the files in the /src directory.

The /examples directory is **optional** and includes patterns and sample datasets for experimentation.
